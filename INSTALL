Prerequisites:
     
     Libraries:
        1. Boost (version 1.42.0.1 or better) and headers for the same.
        2. pHash (version 0.9.0-2 or better)  and headers for the same.

     Tools:
        1. cmake (version 2.6 or better; I used 2.8.2)
        2. A C++ compiler (such as g++)
        3. A build system that cmake can generate instructions for 
        (like GNU's make/autotools)


Build:
     1. Optionally configure cmake to build targets for your 
        preferred build system.

        1.1. Optionally select which build target you want to use by calling
              cmake with the '-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=target_name' option.  

             Available options include:
             
             debug      -  No optimizations, debugging symbols included.
   (default) release    -  Standard (O2) optimizations, stripped executable.
             reldbg     -  Standard (O2) optimizations, debugging symbols
                           included.

     2. Run cmake on the imgfind/ directory
     3. Run make in the imgfind directory 
        (or use your build system of choice)

Install:
     4. Copy the imgfind executable to wherever your system keeps 
        application binaries.
