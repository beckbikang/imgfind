imgfind.cc:

    General:
                    1. Add command-line options parser or similar 
                       (portable version of getopt()?).

    main():


kernel\search.*:

    General:
                    1. Create object class(es) to encapsulate search routines.

                    2. Use a more efficient data structure to hold image hashes
                       and/or similarity information. (pHash MVP tree wrapper?)

    cr_imglist():
                    1. Try to find a portable libmagic or other 'magic number'-
                       based solution to back up the regexp search.

                    2. Make regex / valid image file extensions/types 
                       user-configurable.

    hash_imglist():

                    1. Implement support for the other hash functions 
                       provided by pHash (Marr/'Mexican Hat' gaussian 
                       and Radial hashes).

                    2. Add support for SIFT/SURF-style object recognition
                       algorithm. 

                    3. Add support for saving the generated data to improve
                       reduce time on future runs.

    hash_image():
                    1. Implement support for the previously listed other 
                       hash functions.

    find_similar():
                    1. Implement support for the previously listed other hash
                       functions.

kernel\workers.h:
                    1. Document the functions described in this file.

                    2. Add worker classes for the other pHash algorithms.

kernel\*_w.cc:

CMakeLists.txt:

    General:
                    1. Add install configuration.

                    2. Build and test on platforms other than 
                       Debian GNU/Linux, to include Windows XP, 
                       Windows 7 and Macintosh OS X.
