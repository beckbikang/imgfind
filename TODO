    General:
              1. Add command-line options parser or similar (portable version of getopt()?).

    General:

    cr_imglist():
                    1. Try to find a portable libmagic or other 'magic number'-
                       based solution to back up the regexp search.

                    2. Make regex / valid image file extensions/types 
                       user-configurable.

    hash_imglist():
                    1. Implement portable multithreading, possibly using boost
                       or Intel TBB.

                    2. Implement the other hash functions provided by pHash
                       (Marr/'Mexican Hat' gaussian and Radial hashes).

                    3. Implement a more efficient data-structure to hold the
                       hash/filename data, possibly pHash's MVP tree with a c++ 
                       wrapper.

                    4. Add support for saving the generated data to improve
                       reduce time on future runs.

    hash_image():
                    1. Implement support for the previously listed other 
                       hash functions.

    find_similar():
                    1. Implement support for the previously listed other hash
                       functions
